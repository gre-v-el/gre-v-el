I'm Gabriel and programming is my passion. I started coding as a hobby when I was 12 years old and I have never stopped since then. I particularly enjoy working with low-level languages and focusing on performance. I understand that a language is only a tool, so not all my projects are written in low level languages. When a need arises, I am able to learn a new technology and use it to solve the problem at hand.
